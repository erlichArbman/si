Our primary service involves taking on the responsibility of managing data for our clients so they don't have to, thus allowing our clients to focus on what it is that they do best, while we do what we do best: manage data. However, while of course we do provide the basic services akin to any data management firm (keeping, updating, and organizing data), we set ourself apart from the competition by not stopping there. Here at Synergistic Intentions, we analyze the data of our clients to find oppurtunities for in which our clients could stand to benefit from each other. When our clients seek our services, they are gaining access to our wealth of intellectual capital as we will work to determine what oppurtunities we can leverage between our clients. Together, we will know more. Together, we will do better. Together, we are Synergistic Intentions.</p>

			<h2>Our Success</h2>
			<p>We owe in large part to our clients that took a chance on us by giving us their business when we first started out. Fortunately for them, our innovative data management techniques proved overwhelmingly beneficial to them and many of our clients have expressed a deep sense of gratitude for the services we have provided them. By allowing us to manage their data, many of our clients have found new perspectives on various aspects of their business which has lead to unlocking hidden potential not previously seen.

We have yet to see a single client who didn't experience an outstanding level of satisfaction and benefit from our services, so we encourage any business looking for new hands to handle it's most sensitive of assets to give us a chance.</p>

			<h2>Our Future</h2>
			<p>Our ever increasing market share of the data management market proves to us that our techniques are here to stay. In fact, it has been brought to our attention that many of our competitors have even begun implementing some of our own revolutionary data management techniques. That being said, we do not find this threatening to our business, because any otehr firm that simply mimics our ingenuity will always be a step ahead of us. They may adopt our techniques, but they will never have our vision, insight, and deep understanding of the data management field. It is becoming more and more clear to us here at Synergistic Intentions that the future of data management is now and that we are that future. What is the next step in the ever changing, ever expanding, fast paced world of data management? If you want the answer to that question, seek out our services!</p>

			<p>Another unique aspect of our company is that we reside in what is known as a coworking space, where many companies come together under one roof. We feel that this fits with our company motto of intending synergy, as we can leverage skills provided by other companies that we share the space with. The amalgam of diverse ideas and unique perspectives that our company has access to is just another oppurtunity to set ourselves out from the rest of the pack.</p>
